# In this project I will be build a website from scratch based on an exisiting website
# I will be using DevOps practices to automate the process and documenting the process

### TODO This first stage is to add dummy data to a website and push to GitHub

### TODO The second stage I will be testing the website locally on a virtualmachine.
  I went into the vagrant machine and provisioned it locally to test functionality
  Once the HTTP server was running, I provisined the machine using a shellscript
